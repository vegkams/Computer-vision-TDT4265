1. About this fileThis ReadMe.txt is attached to the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) test dataset. It is provided for a benchmark at the IEEE International Joint Conference for Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2013. Please visit http://benchmark.ini.rub.de for further details. 2. Content of the download packageAlong with this file you should have received a zip-file containing 300 image files with natural traffic scenes 00000.ppm - 00299.ppm3. Competition  You are free to use this data package for any purpose you like. However, we would like to encourage you to participate in the upcomingcompetition (visit http://benchmark.ini.rub.de for further details). The task is to detect traffic signs in natural video images for applicationsin driver assistance scenarios. You should therefor download the corresponding training dataset and develop your traffic sign detector thereon. There are code packages (C++, Matlab) that will assist you in this task. For participation in the competition you should create a zip file containing result files of several runs of your algorithm (with differentparametrizations). Refer to the website for a detailed description of the respective format.Upload the zip file via the section "Submission" on the website. The results will be processed on the server and the performance of your algorithm is immediatlyshown.Good luck!
